A Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their own symbols, which are typical "X" and "O". Here's a description of how the game is played:

Game Setup:

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, creating a total of 9 cells.
Two players take turns to play, with one being assigned "X" and the other "O".
The game starts with an empty grid.
Gameplay:

The first player, who is usually "X," places their symbol in an empty cell of their choice.
The second player, "O," then places their symbol in a different empty cell.
Players continue taking turns, placing their symbols in empty cells until one of the following conditions is met:
a. One player has formed a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols.
b. All cells are filled, resulting in a tie.
Winning Conditions:
A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a:

Horizontal line (top row, middle row, or bottom row).
Vertical line (left column, middle column, or right column).
Diagonal line (top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left).
Tie Condition:
If all cells are filled and no player has formed a winning line, the game ends in a tie.

Strategy:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a relatively simple game with a known optimal strategy. The first player (X) can always force a win or a draw with perfect play. The second player (O) can win if the first player makes a mistake.


Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking empty squares with either X or O in an attempt to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their respective symbols and win the game, while also strategically blocking their opponent from achieving the same goal.
Game Completion:
Once a player wins or the game ends in a tie, the outcome is determined, and the game concludes.

Tic-Tac-Toe is often used as a simple educational tool for teaching basic game theory and strategy. It's also a popular game for children and casual players due to its straightforward rules and quick gameplay.
